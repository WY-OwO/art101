	<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
	<p id='boxed'>We are to work with a partner and debug our previous JavaScript labs.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p id='boxed'>Since both my partner and I had nothing to debug, or we're not aware of any issues with them,
		we decide to proceed to Task X, which is answering JavaScript questions on Stack Overflow.
	<br>It is awfully hard to find questions we can answer, since most questions we find are
	questions regarding things we simply haven't learned, like display issues across different applications
	and devices.</br></p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
