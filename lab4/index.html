	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>We have decided to make a pseudocode for streaming music. We listed the things a music player, such as Spotify, would
	do when we, as user, pick a song to play. We also considered what tasks it will implement with settings decided beforehand,
	such as shuffle and loop. </p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>There were little to no problems during this lab.</p>
	<h2>Result</h2>
	<p>Good stuff. </p>
