					<h2>It's Me! Hi!</h2>
					<p>It's a good day, it be better if I wasn't so tired. Sleep schedule is hard to maintain.</p>
					<p>Hi there! Welcome to Jocelyn's website! You might know me as Wei-Yan, both names are my real names,
						Jocelyn is simply easier for English speakers to refer to me!</p>
					<p>I am an Artist (main digital), trying animator. I use medibang for general drawing and drafting,
						and Adobe Animate and After Effects for animations.</p>
					<p>I also create characters for fun, the image on the right is one of my old characters, her name is Molly!</p>
					<h2>Experience with Coding</h2>
					<p>I have been playing around with HTML and CSS for a year or two prior to taking this course. </p>
					<p>Even though I took HTML/CSS/JavaScript classes this summer for a total of 7 weeks,
						I say I have a fair amount ofexperience with this coding format. </p>
					<p>At least I won't feel completely clueless if shown a wall of combined code of HTML and CSS.
						I was doing that prior to the summer class so I didn't know about CSS sheets
						until then. Coding had never been cleaner since...</p>
