	<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
	<p id='boxed'>We are to work with a partner and learn how to use JSON and APIs.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p id='boxed'>It was overall challenging, but I find appending so many data listed for each comic panel
	to be overwhelming, but after breaking down the code, I eventually did it. Implementing the
page flipping for previous and next were a little confusing, as I thought it was for
the existing comics I randomly generate, but then I was suggested to make a separate
comic panel to control over. Figuring one of the previous and next buttons sped the other up. </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<div id="big-table">
		<div id="boxxu">
			<button id="starting">Start!</button>
			<button id="previous">Previous</button>
			<button id="Next">Next</button>
