    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>We are to work with a partner and experimenting with DOM manipulation on our websites.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There were some difficulties understanding the given instructions for the javascript (task 2), as there were no
			example screenshots for me to reference. This is part of the learning experience though, I should not
			rely on the screenshots every single time.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
