			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>We are to work with a partner and program with javascript data types and variables.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>We were struggling with the layout choice of the page, specifically figuring out how to have the image stay on
				the right side of the screen while all the words stay on the left. We solved that by adding a div block so that
				in the grid, which is what achieved the words and image being on the same level, the words can be grouped into
				the same row and column.
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Results are good! What do you think, looking at this page?</p>
